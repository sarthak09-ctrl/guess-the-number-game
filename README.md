# guess-the-number-game

This is a simple web-based number guessing game where:

The system generates a random number between 1 and 100.

The user enters a guess via an input field.

The game gives real-time feedback:

"Too low" if the guess is lower than the number.

"Too high" if the guess is higher.

"Correct!" if the user guesses right.

Once the correct guess is made, the game ends and shows a "Play Again" button to restart.

Below are the Technologies used in the project:

HTML: Provides the structure (title, input field, buttons, message display).

CSS: Styles the game interface with modern layout, buttons, and responsive design.

JavaScript: Handles the game logic (random number generation, input checking, and feedback display).
